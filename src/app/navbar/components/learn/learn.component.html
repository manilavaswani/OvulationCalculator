      <h2>What is the Menstrual Cycle?</h2>
      <p>The menstrual cycle is a natural, intricate sequence of hormonal and physiological changes that a person's body undergoes every month in preparation for the possibility of pregnancy. It is regulated primarily by fluctuations in hormone levels, especially estrogen and progesterone, which trigger the different phases of the cycle.</p>
      <p>Menstrual cycles are counted from the first day of one period to the day before the next period starts. While the average menstrual cycle is about 28 days, it can vary widely between individuals and can change at different life stages.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Adolescents and teenagers may experience longer cycles, sometimes up to 45 days, as their reproductive systems are still maturing.</li>
        <li>Adults in their 20s and 30s typically have more consistent cycles, ranging between 21 to 38 days.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Factors like stress, diet, health conditions (such as polycystic ovary syndrome, or PCOS), and significant lifestyle changes can also impact the length and regularity of a menstrual cycle.
        Understanding the menstrual cycle is crucial for reproductive health, as it not only influences menstruation but also dictates fertility windows, which are essential for those trying to conceive. It also provides key insights into overall health, as irregularities can signal underlying health conditions.

            <h3>Menstrual Phase</h3>
            <p>This phase marks the beginning of the menstrual cycle. During this time, the uterine lining sheds, resulting in menstrual flow. This typically lasts 3-7 days.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="phase-item">
            <h3>Follicular Phase</h3>
            <p>The follicular phase begins on the first day of menstruation and ends with ovulation. During this time, follicles in the ovary develop and estrogen levels begin to rise.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="phase-item">
            <h3>Ovulation Phase</h3>
            <p>This is when a mature egg is released from the ovary. It usually occurs around day 14 in a 28-day cycle. This is the most fertile time of the cycle.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="phase-item">
            <h3>Luteal Phase</h3>
            <p>After ovulation, the luteal phase begins. The body prepares for possible pregnancy. If fertilization doesn't occur, hormone levels drop and the cycle begins again.</p>
